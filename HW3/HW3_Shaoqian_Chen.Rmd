## Comparing the potential actual Carlson Department stores sale for 2016 September through December with the estimate we see the actual sale was 13.19308, 
## against the estimate of 12.3213. The Calson Store sale trend is actually decreasing, except for the storm period. 
## So it is excess storm related sales
